              Brokers are not permitted to accept transfer of securities as
              margin. Securitiesoffered as margin/ collateral MUST remain in the
              account of the client and can be pledged to the broker only by way
              of 'margin pledge', created in the Depository system. Clients are
              not permitted to place any securities with the broker or associate
              of the broker or authorized person of the broker for any reason.
              Broker can take securities belonging to clients only for
              settlement of securities sold by the client.

              mandatory and you must provide the same to your broker for
              updation in Exchange records. You must immediately take up the
              matter with Stock Broker/Exchange if you are not receiving the
              messages from Exchange/Depositories regularly. Don't ignore any
              emails/SMSs received from the Exchange for trades done by you.
              Verify the same with the Contract notes/Statement of accounts
              received from your broker and report discrepancy, if any, to your

              respond, please take this up with the Exchange/Depositories
              forthwith.
            </p>
            <p>
              Check messages sent by Exchanges on a weekly basis regarding funds
              and securities balances reported by the trading member, compare it
              with the weekly statement of account sent by broker and
              immediately raise a concern to the exchange if you notice a
              discrepancy. Please do not transfer funds, for the purposes of
              trading to anyone, including an authorized person or an associate
              of the broker, other than a SEBI registered entity.
